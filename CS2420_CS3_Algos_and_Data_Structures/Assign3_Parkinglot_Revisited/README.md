Note That these classes should be added to the src folder for assingmetn 1 (Parking Lot).

My code runs. Kinda.

After spending time debugging the assignment, these are my thoughts.

My code returns a solution to a given jam text. It just may not be the idea solution. In some cases, the weights do not permit 
the function to collapse to the solution.

It is difficult to “dial” the knobs to be able to solve all the problems with good efficiency. Its possible to know how to dial 
the inputs so that one puzzle can be solved rapidly, but that may not work for all the problems. For instance in one problem 
the distance to the goal would be a great measure of progress while in another problem the distance to the goal is less 
important because it may be necessary to move the car backwards to move a car from the top to the bottom of the board. Therefore 
the weighting scheme is difficult.

I feel confident that aside from weighting errors the rest of the assignment is coded according to the prompt.

Thanks!
