Script based code to investiage conductive heat transfer between nodes based on adiabatic boundary condtions for lab.

If you want to add more nodes, change the number of node in __main__().
Note that if you do, the the transfer between nodes changes the finite differnce approximation.
Furter research is required to understand how the model need to be altered.
